   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - Internet access is required to download the script. If your target environment is offline or does not allow Internet access, download the script on an Internet-connected device first, then copy it to the target device.
   > - If the command does not respond, or you encounter connection failures, SSL certificate errors, or other issues, refer to the [FAQ](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/blog/details/02176213671719317003).

2. Uninstall the tool.

   ```sh
   python ms_install.py uninstall {tools_name}
   ```

   Replace `{tools_name}` with the name of the tool to be uninstalled. You can run the `python ms_install.py help` command to query the tool name, which is displayed under the `Available Tools` field in the command output.

   If the uninstallation is successful, the following information is displayed:

   ```text
   Successfully uninstalled 1 tool ({tools_name})
   ```

## 5. Upgrade

Upgrades follow the "uninstall first, then install" process. Simply run the installation command. The tool will automatically remove the previous version and guide you through the upgrade process.

You can run the `msopgen --version` command to view the version information of the current environment and then select the version to be upgraded. When upgrading the version, pay attention to the version mapping. For details, see [Release Notes](https://gitcode.com/Ascend/release-management/blob/master/MindStudio/26.0.0/release_notes.md).

## 6. Running UT and ST Cases

`3.7 <= Python version <= 3.11`. Replace `${INSTALL_DIR}` with the path for storing the CANN installation files. For example, if the Ascend-CANN-Toolkit software package is installed, the default installation directory is `$HOME/Ascend/cann`.

```shell
source ${INSTALL_DIR}/set_env.sh
```

The test report is stored in the `output` directory.

```sh
python build.py test
```
